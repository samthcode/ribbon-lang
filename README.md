# The Ribbon Programming Language (WIP)

This language is designed to be quick to write and is heavily inspired by Rust, which is also the language it was created in.

Currently, this language is very incomplete.

## Current Stage

At current, the lexer has not yet been completed, but the groundworks are there.
